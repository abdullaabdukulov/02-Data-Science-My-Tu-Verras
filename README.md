## Welcome

Welcome to the Boston Housing Dataset Exploration and Linear Regression Modeling script.

## Description

This script, written in Python, aims to explore the Boston housing dataset, perform data analysis and visualization, and build a linear regression model. The script uses popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn to conduct various aspects of data analysis, including data loading, cleaning, visualization, correlation analysis, and linear regression modeling.

## Installation

To run this script, follow these installation steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/qorahoja/02-Data-Science-My-Tu-Verras.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd 02-Data-Science-My-Tu-Verras

    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```

## Usage

To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Open the script in your preferred Python environment.

2. Run the script.

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to explore the Boston Housing Dataset and analyze the linear regression model.

## Tasks

1. **Data Loading and Summarization**
   - Load the Boston housing dataset from an online source.
   - Print a summary of the dataset, including dimensions, the first 10 rows, and statistical summaries.

2. **Data Cleaning and Visualization**
   - Clean the dataset by removing any missing values.
   - Visualize the dataset using histograms and scatter plots.

3. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Compute the Pearson correlation matrix to understand the relationships between different variables.

4. **Linear Regression Modeling**
   - Fit a linear regression model using a selected set of features.
   - Make predictions using the fitted model.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Print evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and Root Mean Squared Error to assess the model's performance.
