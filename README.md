## Welcome

Welcome to the Boston Housing Dataset Exploration and Linear Regression Modeling script. This script is designed to load the Boston housing dataset, perform data exploration and visualization, fit a linear regression model, make predictions, and evaluate the model's performance.

## Description

The script is written in Python and utilizes popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn. It covers various aspects of data analysis, including data loading, cleaning, visualization, correlation analysis, and linear regression modeling.

## Tasks

1. **Data Loading and Summarization**
   - Load the Boston housing dataset from an online source.
   - Print a summary of the dataset, including dimensions, the first 10 rows, and statistical summaries.

2. **Data Cleaning and Visualization**
   - Clean the dataset by removing any missing values.
   - Visualize the dataset using histograms and scatter plots.

3. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Compute the Pearson correlation matrix to understand the relationships between different variables.

4. **Linear Regression Modeling**
   - Fit a linear regression model using a selected set of features.
   - Make predictions using the fitted model.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Print evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and Root Mean Squared Error to assess the model's performance.
