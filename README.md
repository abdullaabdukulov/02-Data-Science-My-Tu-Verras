# Welcome to My Tu Verras

<h2>Task</h2>
<p>In this project, we should build a model to predict the price base on predefined criteria.</p>
<p>We are providing a dataset, the <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/qwasar-public/track-ds/boston.csv" target="_blank">Boston housing prices</a>.</p>
<p>This project is divided into two parts:
1# Understand the data
2# Build a linear regression prediction model.</p>

<p>→ <strong>Plot each attribute in a histogram.</strong></p>

<p>→ <strong>Make a function that prints all the histograms.</strong></p>

<p>→ <strong>What is the correlation coefficient between the median value and the number of rooms?</strong></p>

<p>→ <strong>Analyse the correlations between the median value and the other attributes. Which attribute is the most negatively correlated with the median value? Does it make sense to you?</strong></p>

<p>→ <strong>Plot every attribute against each other.</strong></p>

### Description
The original dataset
